The installation of Kepler is included in the Kustomize installation in [infrastructure](../infrastructure) (you might
have to activate it in the kustomization.yaml).

When you've installed Kepler and the monitoring stack, import the [Kepler Exporter Dashboard](./Kepler-Exporter.json)
into Grafana manually.
